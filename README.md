# Pig Dice Duel

A simple two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

Pig Dice Duel is a turn-based dice game where players compete to reach 100 points first. Each turn, a player rolls a dice:

- Rolling a **1** resets the current turn score and passes the turn to the other player.  
- Rolling **2-6** adds the number to the current turn score.  
- Players can **hold** to add the current turn score to their total score.  
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Click **Roll Dice** to roll the dice.  
2. Accumulate points with each roll but watch out for rolling a **1** — you lose your current turn points.  
3. Click **Hold** to save your current turn points to your total score and pass the turn.  
4. The first player to reach **100 points** wins!
